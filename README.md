# phoenix-custom-error-responses-demo

This is a companion repo to [my blog post](https://www.nicholasmoen.com/blog/phoenix-custom-error-responses/) which shows how to easily add custom HTTP responses (with status code and message/payload) to your Elixir + Phoenix REST API.

You are viewing the `phoenix-1.7` branch. [Click here](https://github.com/arcanemachine/phoenix-custom-error-responses-demo/tree/phoenix-1.6) to view the `phoenix-1.6` branch.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
